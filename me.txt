Hi there, my name is Nigam N and I'm currently in my 6th semester of Computer Science Engineering at RNSIT College.
I'm someone who thrives on challenges and always sets goals for myself.I'm always pushing myself to be better and adapt to the evolving technology.
Speaking of technology, I have some technical skills under my belt such as HTML, CSS, Node.js and JavaScript. I have also worked with java and python.During my academics I have built a responsive trekking website and a data visualization project using python Libraries.
Coming to my strengths and weaknesses. One of my biggest strengths is my ability to stay organized and manage my time effectively. 
This has helped me stay on top of my academic work while also pursuing my other interests. On the other hand, my weakness is that I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist.
Overall, I'm someone who is passionate about technology and constantly striving to improve myself. I hope you've enjoyed getting to know me a little better, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you in the future. Thanks for watching!
